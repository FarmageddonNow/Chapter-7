Project Q8

"Write a program that scores a blackjack hand. In blackjack, a player receives from two to five cards. The cards 2 through 10 are scored as 2 through 10 points each. The face cards are scored as 10 ponts. The goal is to come as close to a score of 21 as possible without goin gover 21. Hence, any score over 21 is called "busted." The ace can count as either 1 or 11, whichever is better for the user. 

The user is asked how many cards she or he has, and the user responds with one of the integers 2, 3, 4, or 5. The user is then asked for the card values. Card values are 2 through 10, jack, queen, king, and ace. A good way to handle input is to use the type char so that the card input 2, for example is read as the character '2' rather than as the number 2. Input the values 2 through 9 as the characters '2' through '9'. Input the values 10, jack, queen, king, and ace as the characters 't', 'j', 'q', 'k', and 'a'. Be sure to allow upper as well as lowercase letters as input.

After reading in the values, the program should convert them from characters values to numeric card scores, taking special care for aces. The output is either a number between 2 and 21 (inclusive) or the word Busted. Use lots of functions. You are likely to have one or more long multiway branches that uses a switch statement or nested if-else statement. Your program should include a loop that lets the user repeat this calculation until the user says she or he is done."

Program Q10

"The Fibonacci numbers Fn are defined as follows. F0 is 1, F1 is 1, and Fi2 = Fi + Fi+1, i = 0, 1, 2, ...

In other words, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first few Fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8. One place that these numbers occur is as certain population growth rates. If a population has no deaths, then the series shows the size of the population after each time period. It takes an organism two time periods to mature to reproducing age, and then the organism reproduces once every time period. The formula applies most straightforwardly to asexual reproduction at a rate of one offspring per time period.

Assume that the green crud population grows at this rate and has a time period of 5 days. Hence, if a green crud population starts out as 10 pounds of crud, then in 5 days there is still 10 pounds of crud, in 10 days there is 20 pounds, in 15 days 30 pounds and so forth. Write a program that takes both the initial size of a green crud population (in pounds) and a number of days as input and that outputs the number of pounds of green crud after that many days. Assume that the population size is the same for four days and then increases every fifth day. Your program should allow the user to repeat this calculation  as often as desired."
